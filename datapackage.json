If you want to use these services in a commercial context you must contact partners at last dot fm first to get a seperate license.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the data you are using was generated directly by you (ie. it is your profile data, recent tracks etc) then you can do whatever you want with it. Don't worry about any licensing restrictions.\r\n\r\nIf the data was generated by Last.fm, or other users of the site, then you must abide by the CC license above (or a commercial license from us).\r\n\r\nIf you have ads on the site you wish to use this data on, you might be wondering does that count as commercial use?. If the ads are barely covering your running costs, we consider that non-commercial. Actually we consider most stuff non-commercial. If you are making a healthy profit from your site, and using this data to enhance the site, that sounds commercial. Any queries, just get in touch with us.\"\r\n\r\n## Other formats\r\n\r\nA partial RDF version is available at package:dbtune-audioscrobbler.",
